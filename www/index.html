<h1>My Agenda VR3 Projects</h1>

<p>This page includes information about my spare time software
projects targeted to <a href="http://www.agendacomputing.com/">Agenda
VR3</a> platform. Although I am currently working alone on these
projects, all kind of contributions (ideas, suggestions, bug reports,
new source code, hardware... ;) are welcome.</p>

<p>Projects described here include:
<a href="#npuzzle">NPuzzle</a>,
<a href="#reversi">Reversi</a>,
<a href="#vrfig">VRFig</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="npuzzle">NPuzzle</a></h2>

<p><img src="npuzzle.png" alt="NPuzzle" width="172" height="275"
align="right"><em>NPuzzle</em> is a simple implementation of 15-puzzle
(or 8-puzzle or 24-puzzle) and I wrote it mostly to learn how to work
with FLTK user interface library. NPuzzle has been tested on Agenda
VR3 and I tried to give it the VR3 look and feel. The development was
done in an ordinary Linux/X environment and the VR3 port was done
simply by cross compiling the program for MIPS. NPuzzle is distributed
under the GNU General Public License.</p>

<p>To compile the source code distribution on standard Linux box, you
must have the following installed. For help on compiling the native
VR3 binary, see the end of INSTALL file in the source package.</p>

<ul>
  <li>C++ compiler (tested with <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">g++</a> 2.95.2)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a> UI toolkit (tested with FLTK 1.0.9)</li>
</ul>

<p>Use one of the links below to download a source code or binary
distribution.</p>

<p>
<a href="npuzzle-0.2.1.tar.gz">npuzzle-0.2.1.tar.gz</a> (46.2 kB)<br>
<a href="npuzzle-0.2.1.vrp">npuzzle-0.2.1.vrp</a> (20.0 kB)<br>
<a href="npuzzle-0.2.1">npuzzle-0.2.1</a> for Agenda VR3 (29.6 kB)
</p>

<p>You need only the npuzzle binary to run the
game. Just copy the binary to suitable place on a flash disk (using
<code>rsync</code>, for example) and make a symbolic link
<code>/home/default/.wmx/Games/NPuzzle</code> pointing to the
binary. Remember to make sure that the downloaded binary has execute
permissions (<code>chmod&nbsp;a+rx&nbsp;npuzzle</code>).</p>

<h2><a name="reversi">Reversi</a></h2>

<p><em>Reversi</em> is the second one of my FLTK experiments. My idea
was to build couple of simple games to learn how to use FLTK toolkit.
Reversi is not yet fully functional. I am also planning to add IrDA
support for two player game if possible. Currently the Reversi
development is frozen and I am concentrating on VRFig. Check this page
later for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="vrfig">VRFig</a></h2>

<p><em>VRFig</em> is a simple tool for drawing figures. It has been
developed for PDA use and especially for the <a
href="http://www.agendacomputing.com/">Agenda Computing</a> VR3 Linux
PDA. The goal is to be able to plan things and sketch technical
drawings on the road without always dragging a laptop computer around.
The intended ultimate use could be sketching or browsing a software
architecture diagram while sitting in a bus, for example.</p>
