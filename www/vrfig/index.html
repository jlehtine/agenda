<h2>Description</h2>

<p>VRFig is a simple tool for drawing figures. It has been developed for
PDA use and especially for the <a
href="http://www.agendacomputing.com/">Agenda Computing</a> VR3 Linux
PDA. The goal is to be able to plan things and sketch technical drawings on the
road without always dragging a laptop computer around. The intended
ultimate use could be sketching or browsing a software architecture
diagram while sitting in a bus, for example. The biggest challenge is
to overcome the inherent limitations of a PDA user interface.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be easier to stick to pen and paper then? I don't believe
myself that anything PDA based could come close to the usability of
pen and paper (as long as we are talking about the palm sized PDAs).
However, the one advantage VRFig has over pen and paper is that it is
easier to import/export figures from/to desktop drawing programs.
VRFig is not intended to be a stand-alone fully featured vector
graphics editor but a kind of off-line terminal to a desktop drawing
program.</p>

<p>Parts of the source code (file chooser to be exact) is strongly based
on the ESP Widget Set 2.0 by Easy Software Products. It has been just
modified to match the VR3 look and feel. This code can be found in the
subdirectory 'src/espws'. More information about the ESP Widget Set
and the original source code can be obtained at the URL <a

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>VRFig is currently under development. It is not yet ready for real
intented use. These early releases are mostly targeted to other
developers who are interested in participating the development process
or who want to reuse VRFig source code. VRFig can be already used for
drawing figures and it is able to save and load them but the set of
drawing primitives is still rather limited. The user interface also
needs work and the desktop side interface to desktop drawing programs
(such as XFig) does not exist yet.</p>

<h2>Author</h2>

<p>The VRFig was written and is being developed by <em>Johannes Lehtinen</em>
&lt;&nbsp;<a

If you would like to contribute, please see the corresponding section
in the README file in distribution package.</p>

<a name="download"></a>
<h2>Download</h2>

<p>To download the source code distribution select the package named
<strong>vrfig-VERSION.tar.gz</strong>. If you don't want to compile
the VRFig yourself then download the binary distribution
<strong>vrfig-vr3-VERSION.tar.gz</strong>. The binary version is
compiled for the Agenda VR3 Linux PDA and it is statically linked with
the Expat XML parser library which makes it rather big. Let's hope
that someday Expat will find its way to the standard VR3 distribution.
<em>Note: You can not execute the binary version on your desktop
computer!</em></p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

<p>It is hard to understand the VRFig user interface by looking at the
screenshots alone. For example, if you want to move an element
(polyline, ellipse, rectangle) you select the move tool and then just
"grab" the element on some line and move it to a new position. Anyway,
here are the screenshots. The file chooser is based on ESP Widget Set
by <a href="http://www.easysw.com/">Easy Software Products</a>. It is
a totally separate piece of code so if you like it, it should be easy
to use it in your program.</p>
