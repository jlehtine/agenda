    <h2><a id="description"></a>Description</h2>

    <p>
      VRFig is a simple tool for drawing figures. It has been developed for
      PDA use and especially for the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_VR3">Agenda VR3</a> Linux
      PDA. The goal is to be able to plan things and sketch technical drawings
      on the road without always dragging a laptop computer around. The
      intended ultimate use could be sketching or browsing a software
      architecture diagram while sitting in a bus, for example. The biggest
      challenge is to overcome the inherent limitations of a PDA user
      interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wouldn't it be easier to stick to pen and paper then? I don't believe
      myself that anything PDA based could come close to the usability of
      pen and paper (as long as we are talking about the palm sized PDAs).
      However, the one advantage VRFig has over pen and paper is that it is
      easier to import/export figures from/to desktop drawing programs.
      VRFig is not intended to be a stand-alone fully featured vector
      graphics editor but a kind of off-line terminal to a desktop drawing
      program.

    <h2><a id="status"></a>Status</h2>

    <p>
      VRFig is currently under development. It is not yet ready for real
      intented use. These early releases are mostly targeted to other
      developers who are interested in participating the development process
      or who want to reuse VRFig source code. VRFig can be already used for
      drawing figures and it is able to save and load them but the set of
      drawing primitives is still rather limited. The user interface also
      needs work and the desktop side interface to desktop drawing programs
      (such as XFig) does not exist yet.
    </p>

    <h2><a id="author"></a>Author</h2>

    <p>
      The VRFig was written and is being developed by
      <em>Johannes Lehtinen</em>
      &lt;<a href="mailto:johannes.lehtinen@iki.fi">johannes.lehtinen@iki.fi</a>&gt;.
      If you would like to contribute, please see the corresponding section
      of the README file included in the distribution archive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The file chooser used in the VRFig is strongly based on the ESP
      Widget Set 2.0 by Easy Software Products. It has been just modified to
      match the VR3 look and feel (to use the flpda library). This code can
      be found in the subdirectory 'src/espws'. More information about the
      ESP Widget Set and the original source code can be obtained at the URL
      <span class="deadlink">http://www.easysw.com/~mike/espws/</span>
      (update: the link is not valid anymore).
    </p>

    <h2><a id="download"></a>Download</h2>

    <p>
      To download the source code distribution select the package named
      <strong>vrfig-VERSION.tar.gz</strong>. If you don't want to compile
      the VRFig yourself then download the binary distribution
      <strong>vrfig-vr3-VERSION.tar.gz</strong>. The binary version is
      compiled for the Agenda VR3 Linux PDA and it includes the Expat XML
      parser shared library which is needed by VRFig.
      <em>Note: You can not execute the binary version on your desktop
        computer!</em>

        Vertex code cleanup. No (intentional) functional modifications
        but makes the code much more readable...

    <h2><a id="screenshots"></a>Screenshots</h2>

    <p>
      It is hard to understand the VRFig user interface by looking at the
      screenshots alone. For example, if you want to move an element
      (polyline, ellipse, rectangle) you select the move tool and then just
      "grab" the element on some line and move it to a new position. Anyway,
      here are the screenshots. The file chooser is based on ESP Widget Set
      by Easy Software Products. It is
      a totally separate piece of code so if you like it, it should be easy
      to use it in your program.
