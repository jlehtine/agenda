2001-05-28, development release 0.2
-----------------------------------

The 0.2 release fixes few bugs found in the 0.1 release but it mainly
adds new functionality. The new code has not been thoroughly tested so
this should still be considered being very experimental code. However,
I am happy with how the framework is forming and the drawing
primitives seem to fit it quite nicely.

The next step is to start testing the code more thoroughly and see
whether the user interface could be improved. There are still few
primitives that need to be added to make the VRFig really usable. I
will be rather busy for the next couple of weeks so it might take some
time to get the 0.3 release out. Blame my real job for that :)


2001-05-23, development release 0.1
-----------------------------------

This is the first public release of VRFig. It is mostly targeted to
other developers who might be interested in participating the
development work or reusing the source code. I am trying to come up
with another release quite soon, adding some of the missing elements
(such as text labels).
