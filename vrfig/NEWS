2001-05-23, development release 0.1
-----------------------------------

This is the first public release of VRFig. It is mostly targeted to
other developers who might be interested in participating the
development work or reusing the source code. I am trying to come up
with another release quite soon, adding some of the missing elements
(such as text labels).
