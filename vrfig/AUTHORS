The VRFig was written and is being developed by

	Johannes Lehtinen
	<johannes.lehtinen@iki.fi>

The file chooser used in the VRFig is strongly based on the ESP Widget
Set 2.0 by Easy Software Products. It has been just modified to match
the VR3 look and feel (to use the flpda library). This code can be
found in the subdirectory 'src/espws'. More information about the ESP
Widget Set and the original source code can be obtained at the URL

However, the VRFig wouldn't exist without the available open source
software and tools. The VRFig uses several external open source
software components by various authors. The following list tries to
acknowledge the non-system libraries utilized by VRFig (sorry if I
missed some).

	* The Fast Light Tool Kit (FLTK) user interface library
          originally by Bill Spitzak and currently being maintained by
          Michael Sweet, Craig P. Earls, Bill Spitzak and others
          (patched by Agenda Computing for their VR3 Linux PDA) (GNU
          Library General Public License)

	* The Fast Light Environment Kit (FLEK) by James Dean Palmer
          and others (patched by Agenda Computing for their VR3 Linux
          PDA) (GNU Library General Public License)

	* The flpda user interface library by Agenda Computing and
          Bradley D. LaRonde (GNU General Public License)

	* The Expat XML parser library by James Clark (MIT/X
          Consortium License)

	* File chooser from ESP Widget Set by Easy Software Products
          (modified by Johannes Lehtinen to match VR3 look and feel)
          (GNU General Public License)


Special thanks go to Bradley D. LaRonde for pushing the development of
Linux and open source based PDA products.

If you would like to participate the development process by fixing
bugs or adding features, please read the README file for instructions
on how to contribute.
