NPuzzle News
============

v 0.2.1
-------

The version 0.2.1 is functionally equivalent with the version 0.2. I
had to make few modifications to make the source code compile
correctly with the latest Agenda Computing FLTK patches. Additionally,
I added some kind of support for vrpbuild which can be used to build
.vrp packages.


v 0.2
-----

This is the first release of NPuzzle tested on actual Agenda VR3
device. It was also heavily customized to match the VR3 look and feel.
Functionality of the game is exactly the same as for the previous
release. I think that NPuzzle is now more or less ready and I am not
planning any changes at the moment.

I originally wrote NPuzzle to learn how to use FLTK and I think I
might be writing another simple game (maybe Reversi) before starting
to work on real applications for VR3. I am planning to write an
application that would make it easy to mix textual notes and sketched
diagrams.
