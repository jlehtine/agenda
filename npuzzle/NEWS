NPuzzle News
============

This is the first release of NPuzzle and it is a very early release,
indeed. I haven't had a chance to try NPuzzle on Agenda VR3 yet but I
hope I will get my device soon and be able to prepare a real package
specifically for VR3.

I originally wrote NPuzzle to learn how to use FLTK and I think I
might be writing another simple game (maybe Reversi) before starting
to work on real applications for VR3. I am planning to write an
application that would make it easy to mix textual notes and sketched
diagrams.
