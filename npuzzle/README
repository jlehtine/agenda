NPuzzle
=======

NPuzzle is a very simple 15-puzzle (or 8-puzzle, or 24-puzzle)
implementation. It has been written specifically for Agenda VR3(*) but
because I don't have the VR3 device yet, I have not been able to test
it with the actual hardware. However, it runs nicely in standard
Linux/X environment so I decided to make an early release in case
someone would like to try it out.
