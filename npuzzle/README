NPuzzle
=======

NPuzzle is a very simple 15-puzzle (or 8-puzzle, or 24-puzzle)
implementation. It has been written specifically for Agenda VR3(*) and
therefore I have tried to make it match the look and feel of VR3.
However, it should also compile and run nicely on most standard Unix/X
environments although the user interface is not very usable on high
resolution displays. The software was developed on Linux desktop box
using XFree86 development environment.
