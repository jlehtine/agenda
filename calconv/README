ABOUT
-----

  Calconv is a very simple utility for converting Agenda VR3 Schedule
  application database from the old pre-Matrix format to the new
  format used in the Matrix release.

    usage: calconv <old database file> <converted database file>

  THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. It might
  destroy the database being converted or introduce conversion errors
  that prevent the new database to be used with the Schedule
  application. Keep copy of the unconverted database for backup as
  long as it contains data that you might need.

  Notice that you must backup all your personal data _before_ flashing
  the Matrix release.
