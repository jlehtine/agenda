  Calconv is a very simple utility for converting the Agenda VR3
  Schedule application database from the old pre-Matrix format to the
  new format used in the Matrix release.

    usage: calconv <old database file> <converted database file>

  THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. Keep the old
  unconverted Schedule database for backup as long as it contains data
  that you might need.

  Notice that you must backup all your personal data _before_ flashing
  the Matrix release.
